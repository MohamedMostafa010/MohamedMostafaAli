To update your GitHub Pages website while in the directory of your website, follow these steps:

1. Make your changes to the files in your website directory (such as editing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files).

2. Add the changes: git add .

3. Commit the changes with a message describing what you updated: git commit -m "Describe your changes here"

4. Push the changes to GitHub: git push origin main , (If you're using a different branch, replace `main` with your branch name.)

Once the changes are pushed, GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild your website based on the latest files. It may take a minute or two for the changes to reflect online.
